            <p>
              We worship and serve the only One True God, who revealed Himself
              in the Bible as three persons in the mystery of the Trinity: God
              the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.{" "}

            <h2>JESUS</h2>
            <p>
              Jesus Christ is the Son of God, being fully God and fully man. He
              was conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, lived a
              sinless life but suffered and died in the place of sinful man, was
              buried and resurrected, ascended bodily into heaven, and is
              preparing to return bodily in glory to earth a second time.{" "}

            <h2>HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
            <p>
              The Holy Spirit is God, who is actively at work in the world. He
              dwells permanently in every believer, helps us to pray, equips and
              empowers us to serve God, strengthens and molds us to be more like
              Christ, and protects us to guarantee our eternal life.{" "}

            <p>
              We believe that the sign gifts, especially speaking in tongues and
              miracle healing, were given to authenticate the Apostles' message
              and establish the early church.{" "}
              <span className="foundation-ref">
                (2 Corinthians 12:12, 1 Corinthians 13:10-11)
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              God is Sovereign and may allow a miraculous sign, such as tongues,
              healing, or special revelation, particularly where the gospel is
              forbidden or unavailable.{" "}
              <span className="foundation-ref">(1 Corinthians 14:21-22)</span>{" "}
              However, these would be counted as miracles, not the norm, and we
              do not expect or promote such signs.{" "}

            <h2>THE BIBLE</h2>
            <p>
              The Bible is the inspired, inerrant, infallible Word of God, so it
              is our only sure source of knowledge about God and His plans and
              is the final authority and our absolute guide for doctrinal
              teaching and godly living.{" "}

            <h2>ANGELS</h2>
            <p>
              Angels are the innumerable and unseen creatures who serve the
              causes of God and His people. Satan and demons are fallen angels
              who promote wickedness and oppose God's purposes, doomed and
              awaiting their final judgment.{" "}

          <div>
            <h2>MAN</h2>
            <p>
              God created man, male and female, in His image. Man was originally
              sinless, but through Adam, all mankind sinned, became condemned,
              separated from God, and was rendered totally unable to gain God's
              favor of forgiveness and eternal life.{" "}

          <div>
            <h2>SALVATION</h2>
            <p>
              Salvation is God's act of forgiving sins, reconciling people to
              Himself, and giving a new nature and eternal life to those who put
              their trust in the finished work of Jesus Christ. Salvation is not
              a reward for good works but a free gift of God received by grace
              through faith in Christ alone and secured eternally by the
              indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.{" "}
              <span className="foundation-ref">

            <h2>THE CHURCH</h2>
            <p>
              The Church is the universal Body of Christ, consisting of all
              born-again Christians united by the indwelling Holy Spirit. A
              member of a local church must have undergone baptism by immersion,
              participate in Communion, and help fulfill the church mission to
              make disciples of all nations.{" "}

            <h2>THE END TIMES</h2>
            <p>
              Jesus Christ will come again to reign on earth, to reward God's
              people with life with Him forever in the new heaven and earth, and
              to judge unbelievers with eternal separation from God and
              suffering in hell.{" "}

              This Doctrinal Statement does not exhaust the extent of our
              beliefs, the Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of
              God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality,
              and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final source of
              all that we believe.
